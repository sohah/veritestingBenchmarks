- TCAS
Traffic Anti-Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is a system to avoid air collisions. Its code in C together with 41 mutants are available at SIR repository. We manually converted the code to Java. The Java version has 143 lines of code.

The original version v0 and three randomly selected mutant versions v6, v25, and v30 are used in our study. Compared to the original version v0, version v6 has an operator change from “<” to “<=”, v25 has an operator change, and v30 has a return value change.
