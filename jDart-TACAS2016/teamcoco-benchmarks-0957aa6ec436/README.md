# Benchmarks #
Small benchmarks used for evaluating JDart. Most involve complex mathematical constraints (non-linear, transcendental functions...)

* TCAS
* TSAFE -- predicts and resolves air traffic collisions
* Apollo
* Coral -- test suite of +50 cases with trigonometric functions
* DART -- used in dart paper
* early
* ej_hash -- provokes five collision variants in a common hash function
* optimization -- six non-linear benchmark functions from FloPSy
* power
* raytrace -- ray tracing renderer
* sine -- from jpf-symbc
* statcalc -- computes mean and standard deviation of a list of numbers
* bouncycastle -- crypto
* jembench -- collection of micro benchmarks and real-world benchmarks. Real-world examples comrprise KFL (mast stations), Lift system, stream processing, UDPIP examples, etc.
