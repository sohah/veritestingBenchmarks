- WBS
Wheel Brake System (WBS) is a synchronous reactive component from the automotive domain. This method determines how much braking pressure to apply based on the environment. The Java model is based on a Simulink model derived from the WBS case example found in ARP 4761. The Simulink model was translated to C using tools developed at Rockwell Collins and manually translated to Java. It consists of one class and 231 lines of code.
